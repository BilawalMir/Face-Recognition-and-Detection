# Face Recognition Project

This project uses the `face_recognition` library for facial recognition tasks in Python. It leverages the `dlib` library under the hood to perform fast and accurate face detection and recognition.

---

## Features

- Detect faces in images
- Recognize and compare faces
- Extract facial landmarks
- Encode faces for machine learning tasks

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 (recommended)
- `face_recognition` library
- `dlib` library (precompiled for Windows)
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`

---

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Install Python 3.10

Make sure Python 3.10 is installed and added to your system PATH.

### 2. Install dependencies

Open your terminal or PowerShell and run:

```bash
pip install numpy Pillow face_recognition
````

### 3. Install dlib (Windows specific)

`dlib` can be tricky to install on Windows due to native dependencies. Follow these steps:

* Download the correct precompiled wheel from [Christoph Gohlke’s unofficial binaries](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#dlib):

  ```
  dlib‑19.24.0‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
  ```

* Install the wheel (adjust filename as needed):

  ```bash
  pip install dlib‑19.24.0‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
  ```

* If you encounter DLL errors, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:

  [Download here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

---

## Usage

Run your main script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure your script imports `face_recognition` and uses it as intended.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **DLL load failed errors:**
  Ensure the correct `dlib` version is installed for your Python version.
  Install Visual C++ Redistributable if missing.

* **Wheel not supported on this platform:**
  Check your Python version and architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit) and download the matching wheel.
